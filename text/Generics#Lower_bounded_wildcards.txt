 <? super ClassName> specifies a restriction on the types of classes that may be used. For example, to declare a Comparator that can compare Dogs, you use: Now suppose you define a comparator that can compare Animals: Since Dogs are Animals, you can use this comparator to compare Dogs also. Comparators for any superclass of Dog can also compare Dog; but comparators for any strict subclass cannot. The above code is valid because the Animal class is a supertype of the Dog class. Use of a class that is not a supertype would cause a compilation error.
