explaining the adopted technical choice: why this given algorithm and not another, why calling this given method...
explaining what should be done in the next steps (the TODO list): improvement, issue to fix...
giving the required explanation to understand the code and be able to update it yourself later or by other developers.
 It can also be used to make the compiler ignore a portion of code: temporary code for debugging, code under development...
