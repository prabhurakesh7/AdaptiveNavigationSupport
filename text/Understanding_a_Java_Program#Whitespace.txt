 Whitespace in Java is used to separate the tokens in a Java source file. Whitespace is required in some places, such as between access modifiers, type names and Identifiers, and is used to improve readability elsewhere. Wherever whitespace is required in Java, one or more whitespace characters may be used. Wherever whitespace is optional in Java, zero or more whitespace characters may be used. Java whitespace consists of the 
space character ' ' (0x20),
the tab character (hex 0x09),
the form feed character (hex 0x0c),
the line separators characters newline (hex 0x0a) or carriage return (hex 0x0d) characters.
 Line separators are special whitespace characters in that they also terminate line comments, whereas normal whitespace does not. Other Unicode space characters, including vertical tab, are not allowed as whitespace in Java.
