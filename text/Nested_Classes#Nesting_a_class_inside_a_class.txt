 When a class is declared inside another class, the nested class' access modifier can be public, private, protected or package(default). The inner class has access to the enclosing class instance's variables and methods, even private ones, as seen above. This makes it very different from the nested class in C++, which are equivalent to the "static" inner classes, see below. An inner object has a reference to the outer object. In other words, all inner objects are tied to the outer object. The inner object can only be created through a reference to the 'outer' object. See below. Note that inner objects, because they are tied to the outer object, cannot contain static variables or methods. When in a non-static method of the outer class, you can directly use new InnerClass(), since the class instance is implied to be this. You can directly access the reference to the outer object from within an inner class with the syntax OuterClass.this; although this is usually unnecessary because you already have access to its fields and methods. Inner classes compile to separate ".class" bytecode files, with the name of the enclosing class, followed by a "$", followed by the name of the inner class. So for example, the above inner class would be compiled to a file named "OuterClass$InnerClass.class".
