 
If a class has public visibility, the class can be referenced by anywhere in the program.
If a class has package visibility, the class can be referenced only in the package where the class is defined.
If a class has private visibility, (it can happen only if the class is defined nested in an other class) the class can be accessed only in the outer class.
