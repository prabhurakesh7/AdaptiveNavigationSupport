algorithm faster linear search 
heard faster algorithm faster linear search unsorted array run algorithm linear random array length average time find 75ns algorithm shorter average 68ns strong edit strong lot didnt proper benchmark fluke ran functions times average time ran functions times 76ns algorithm 69ns algorithm javas measure code 

methods return isnt action inside loops href http whatis techtarget definition time compiler jit jit compiler jvm strong optimizes strong code words modifies byte code loading jvm methods strong strong significant completely removes loops jit optimization pretty smart identify lot situations needed load code jvm code em em byte code file measure random numbers real time complexity methods read href http stackoverflow make jvm compiler optimization occurs apply run benchmark change methods return index making life optimizer harder surprisingly difficult create code impossible optimized turning optimization link reliable hr generally doesnt make sense benchmark unoptimized code case op measure em theoretical em algorithm measure real number passes ensure loops performed turn optimization op thought measured speed algorithm fact algorithm chance run turning jit optimization em case em fixes benchmark
