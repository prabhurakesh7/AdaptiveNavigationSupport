shown list filter numbers achieve method possibility achieve method hope method filtered elements performing bynaryoperation return reduced list understanding correct method method 

understanding reduction wrong apply function elements repeatedly em single result em reduce pre class lang prettyprint override fact pre class lang prettyprint override conceptional view exact order operations unspecified sequential execution parallel execution mixture execution tree partial sequential execution hr abuse create result list convert element list operation concatenates list problems ul li doesn provide desired skip element original list logic tree clear impossible formulate correct function execution scenario li li creating temporary lists concatenating inefficient li ul point solved em mutable em reduction mutable lists add items address point including desired filter violate contract work sequential execution solution define elements scope source list mutable reduction create result list big surprise original code
