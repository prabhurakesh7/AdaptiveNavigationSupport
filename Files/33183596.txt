shortest palindrome recursive solution issue 
debugging problem recursive solution confused logical meaning loop insights appreciated sharing string allowed convert palindrome adding characters front find return shortest palindrome find performing transformation aacecaaa return aaacecaaa abcd return dcbabcd kmp based solution advance lin 

original comment incorrect youve pointed addition check complete palindrome find intelligently guess index wrap reverse trailing characters longest palindrome exist beginning string understanding algorithm resulting shortest palindrome appending start suffix consists character reversed solution case worst case scenario match palindrome sequence wrap character honest confident algorithm debugging work correctly cases find failed test case algorithm intuitive strong edit strong shortest palindrome derived deterministically recursion algorithm debugging recursion masks side effect opinion heres determine intuitive manner pasted test cases implementation href https ideone kfenwo rel nofollow ideone
