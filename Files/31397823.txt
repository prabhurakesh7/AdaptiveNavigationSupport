array bubble sorting 
newbie learn problems bubble sorting problems line understanding outer loop starts loop runs increases time reaches outer loop advance outer loop advances happen number loop runs number number number number number numbers greater numbers numbers swapped comparing bubble sort works compares understand codes line result comparing neighboring figures supposed bubble sort point thought wrong grateful points greater detail lines work step step breakdown provided 

multiple implementations bubble sort suggested kinar case picking indices line iterates array line comparing jth element array ith element number loop runs compares elements array nth index ith element greater number swapped number make numbers ascending order remember end iteration element place sorting order end ith iteration array number loop runs compares elements nth index ith element greater number swapped number important tip line line accessing numbers program access numbers statement line error hope helps
