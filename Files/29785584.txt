array lists faster linked list lifo behaviour 
written algorithm lot appending removing items end data structure basically reason operation faster arraylist requires overhead relocations slightly faster faster miles 

time insert linkedlist object allocated insert arraylist allocation occurs space point doubles space wont allocate space cost creating objects linkedlist difference
