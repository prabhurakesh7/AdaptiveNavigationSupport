stream iterate taking elements time 
lets stream save map couples adjacent strings starts err thought totally satisfied main reasons ol li misusing function stream api function clear defined purpose supposed calcuate max supposed filter based condition supposed produce incrementally accumulated li li prevents streams powerful mechanisms wanted limit search results li ol function lets compare couple values lead back similar current concepts iterate stream iteration h1 edit h1 thinking mechanism current element define window elements iteration powerful upgrade current api h1 edit2 h1 effort people proposing solution issue algorithm se ways achieve goal putting streams indexes temp variables store previous values wondering method stream api designed task dealing elements current breaking stream paradigm answers clear quick solution streamex library
