triangle puzzle find maximum total top bottom starting top moving moving adjacent numbers 
title suggests solve puzzle path find max sum top bottom moving adjacent children path sum code works set data input attempt puzzles provided textfiles data sum answer accepted correct life figure wrong code exception essentially algorithm works adding string ints text file array selected index root node find child add selected index rows length subtract find left child index ideas 

algorithm wrong logic case algorithm works required properties make algorithm work inputs case extreme algorithm works simply selecting child larger sum case algorithm result path correct algorithm result correct algorithm require traverse tree search strong strong paths order find correct solution hr johnbollinger mentioned br top bottom approach pretty simple cost efficiency efficient efficient solution traverses node stated algorithm tree represents time node visited pascals triangle making array lookups bottom top approach require lookups basic idea sums values sums produced level simply start searching bottom searching maximum path node level bottom maximum maximum path left child maximum path child node
