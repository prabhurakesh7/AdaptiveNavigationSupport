create lazy infinite collection defined recursion 
create recursive closure sense contrary created lazy infinite list stream recursion nice member calculated thought construction wont work item stream index problem ill stream consumed repeatedly copy stream list lazy anymore result construction address index edit solution stream stream dont repeat calculations call 

solution created class representation lazy infinite sequence objects defined lambda function integer argument function iterative iterative case class method setting start values declaration object class notice recursive lambda question declare object define recursively operator operator declaration definition class definition recursive function easily meet stackoverflowerror organize recursion case recursive sequence roll back met throw exception functionalsequence function results stack limited 256k testing repeatable call index takes practically time iterations made reach stackoverflowerror reached reachable made
