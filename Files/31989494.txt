chained nested method calls 
working jsonobject multiple jsonobjects fill content friend told bad practice nested function method calls view chained method call nested dont force program object put method returns case nested function calls case dangerous bad reason reasons edit dont feel question duplicated question involves chained methods talks interfaces
