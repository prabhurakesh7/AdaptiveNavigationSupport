hazelcast distribute data network implementation imap objects store objects essentially hashmap wondering efficient distribute map maps hazelcast read href https github hazelcast hazelcast issues rel nofollow long forgotten issue bug tracker progress made implementing functionality absence core hazelcast feature efficient managing kind data structure current approach 

hazelcast doesnt support map map key values solution make composite key warned access values access round trip disadvantage difficult key2 values key1 find attributes employee approach prevents unwanted serialization deserialization combining map access entryprocessor fine control data send returned entryprocessor dont worried data races provided entryprocessor box api pretty trick efficient manner case suggest object memory format advantage approach easy values grouped hashmap infinite number columns lead problems hashmap isnt distributed issue composite key approach depends bit usecase
