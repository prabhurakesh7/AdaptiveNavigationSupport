endless audioinputstream socket 
problem creation audioinputstream socket important parts code throws unsupportedaudiofileexception line code plays sound loads sample frames audioinputstream plays frames finishes guess solve issue pass audioformat directly parameter audioinputstream inicialization doesnt receiving audio format specifications server solution create dataline pass parametr audioinputstream constructor data socket directly dataline solution infinite loop reads data writes dataline wasteful direct approach hope solve openal library change speed hope wont 

finally solved issue turned openal streaming support built wasnt documentation github didnt notice createoutputstream method source class returns outputstream write bytes directly outputstream code snippet initialize openal play method called inputstream createsource method parameters returns instance source dont call play method source handled sourceoutputstream class instance returned createoutputstream method wrong calling play method manually bad experience buffers empty basically doesnt start playing begin streaming data openal outputwriter code takes care passing bytes inputstream outputstream nice day
