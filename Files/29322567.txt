hashmap works 
preparing interviews checking popular questions understand completely hashmap works internally wrote notes bit confused crosscheck notes missunderstanding answer questions hashmap works store pair values hashmap put key key object internally hashcode key calling hashcode method objects extends object ll hashcode automatically generated hashcode key create bucket bucket list entries keys hashcode basically bucket unique hashcode bucket ll list entries sharing hashcode keys hashcode bucket specific key ll iterate list entries equals method find match notes questions question object key hashmap forced overwrite provide implementation hashcode understand equals objects hashcode distinc hashcode isnt hashcode automatically generated creating object output means objects distinct clear forced overwrite method question overwrite hascode overwritten method account order generate integer question keys map primitive primitive values objects calling hashcode method dont hash keys primitive values keys taking time
