pointed comments current answer crucial make method agnostic part tree drawn absolute coordinates method track em em passing recursive method describes starting point current tree part dont explicit code draw branches strong single line strong tree branches smaller trees strong single lines strong length widths angle compared previous tree mention angle screenshot img src http stack imgur newtf png alt recursivetree
