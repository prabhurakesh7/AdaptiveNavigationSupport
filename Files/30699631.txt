basic threading threads slower threading 
core cpu create threads run cpu intensive loop takes 4x longer running procedurally thread created projects compare threading ill show code run times reason project threading weird wanted replicate memory overhead wasnt effect run time heres code threading runs seconds heres code threading runs minute seconds learning call thread sleep lead 50ms threads run faster call thread sleep threaded class great work reason learning pathfinding add sleep call takes long time doesnt pause 1ms absolutely wondering missing threads absolutely put sleep object wait order work intend running loops parallel making mistake longer worst case scenario run seconds finish unforeseeable order
