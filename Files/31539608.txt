threading method object return 
pretty multithreading invoke method asynchronously separate invoking synchronously basic idea creating socket server object memory client run asynchronously constructs found ol li class implement runnable threading li li declaring class method li ol additionally method return achieve point direction implementing implement option doesnt processing concurrently instantiating single test object server calling getstuff client connection 

blockquote constructs found class implement runnable threading declaring runnable class method blockquote option programs improved em em classes fewer named entity program package class method responsibility option class em em things option dont declare class em anonymous class em java8 em lambda expression em google learn blockquote additionally method return blockquote classic object return fields thread terminates parent thread examine object return afterward blockquote executor callable achieve blockquote lot people em good thing em sounds creating server serves multiple clients clients continually connect disconnect advantage em thread pool em saves program continually creating destroying threads time client connects disconnects creating destroying threads expensive lot clients connecting disconnecting thread pool make big difference performance server
