avoiding biginteger class large numbers arithmetic 
performing mod arithmetic type stuff string char initial depnding ascii position string numbers large initial worth noting numerical characters add total avoid bigint class interested suppose usual work sorted list integers solve problem single character generates bigint formula character place mod operator arithmetic wont turn properly bignum exceeds size long int foo declared realize declare biginteger objects add values totalvalue perform final mod operation total id avoid biginteger arithmetic havent pain ass generally unnecessary case therell approaches wouldnt mind hearing perspectives advance heres code works long threshold broken hr edit response david wallaces answer reread explanation understand youre answer precisely trouble dealing case character number adds numerical multiplying pos running total numerical values order add final answer modding exceeds mod figure increase power missing commented code half attempt solving problem
