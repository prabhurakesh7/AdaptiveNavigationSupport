number expressed sum consecutive perfect squares 
recent computer programming competition problem determine number lt lt palindromic square palindromic square number read forwards backwards expressed sum consecutive perfect squares palindrome expressed understand determine number palindrome trouble figure expressed sum consecutive squares algorithm div class snippet data lang js data hide false div class snippet code pre class snippet code html lang html prettyprint override approach sets upper boundary closest square root number sets lower bound evaluating sum squares lower bound upper bound issue lower bound upper bound stays 

efficient algorithm determining sum squares consecutive numbers ol li start lower bound upper bound current sum squares li li maximum upper bound maximum number square equal number test li li loop sum squares add square incrementing sum squares high subtract square incrementing exit number found expressed sum squares consecutive numbers eventually exceed returned li ol tests arent palindromes testing sum squares consecutive numbers part
