water capacity 2d array 
exercise university stuck exercise calculating water capacity 2d array user enter width height 2d array elements array represent height location simple output maximum water fits output important mention width height array larger heights element larger basically solution fast larger inputs add heights treeset time poll highest array edges dfs check position water stay water doesnt array calculate positions water array poll peaks array vertically horizontally give peaks color black white colors minimum peak dfs minimum calculate water capacity doesnt work peak water level wont work solution fast efficient part code magic resetting paths colors time part improved dfs colors black visited gray edge white visited edge strong update strong dufresnb referred talentbuddy exercise href https www talentbuddy challenge 526efd7f4af0110af3836603 rel nofollow https www talentbuddy challenge 526efd7f4af0110af3836603 tested al lot solutions make test cases fail easy talent buddy bad job making test cases fact solutions register enter code language pass test cases strong update strong tobias solution working solution solution efficient pass larger input test cases idea efficient implementation ideas appreciated
