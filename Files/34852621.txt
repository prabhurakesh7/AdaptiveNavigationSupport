blockquote methods declared interfaces abstract blockquote interfaces abstract methods blockquote static methods interfaces blockquote pretty declare static methods interfaces point static methods called put interface put static class blockquote achieve multiple inheritance abstract class interface blockquote support multiple inheritance class inherit class strong strong multiple inheritance greatly increases complexity code classes implement multiple interfaces em polymorphism em btw abstract classes kind class blockquote implementation blockquote depends implementation implement interfaces language implementations interfaces language explicitly implement interface edit reading comment showing class inherits abstract class interface luckily project kind things wrote tetris game long time ago basic model class represents single tetris block class represents block tetris blocks lot kinds tetriminos abstract class classes inherit tetriminos rotate rotate implements interface called dont interface implementations ability relations case tetriminos ability rotate dont tetriminos implement interface dont makes perfect sense doesnt put rotate method tetrimino class interface asked imo object oriented language point oop make things make sense good make code make sense confused lot thought writing code practical stuff isnt story make things make sense point oop
