problem statement pointer head nodes linked lists merge node find node merger head nodes null input format complete int findmergenode node heada node headb method takes arguments heads linked lists read input stdin console output format find node lists merge return data node print stdout console reverse lists walk seperately reach common node tested giving correct ouput thinking wrong code wrong good approach bad code link question href https www hackerrank challenges find merge point joined linked lists rel nofollow https www hackerrank challenges find merge point joined linked lists strong edit strong karthiks answer modified loop giving wrong output 

strong edit clear explanation strong meant merging values reversing approach works meant merging actual nodes reversing approach work reverse list pointer list reverse pointer reverse tree point depending reversed strong easier approach implementation wise strong push nodes finish nodes start ing elements return node strong explanation answers original question strong check logic loop 3rd loop wrong main point find node return previous node
