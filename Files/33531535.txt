code calculate entropy conditional entropy data set correctly 
writing calculate things entropy joint entropy conditional entropy data set class question past days figure entropy calculation calculation conditional entropy formulas sigma log xy sigma log xy values entropy conditional entropy data set testing values compiles correctly pretty calculations conditional entropy incorrect making mistake values unit tests values output functions point testing male survived calculate checked work calculating values hand image href http imgur vhj8ff3 rel nofollow code giving values problem hand functions pretty simple entropy joint entropy functions assumed fine wrong functions wrote calculate information gain symmetrical uncertainty set original survive sex set gave answer slightly negative negative assumed rounding error run program values symmetrical uncertainty made sense 

tldr calculation apparently assumes independent results turn results equal problem correct formula joint entropy href https en wikipedia org wiki joint entropy rel nofollow wikipedia href http stack imgur bhmzf png rel nofollow img src http stack imgur bhmzf png alt enter image description wrong substituting assumes variables independent variables em em independent holds doesnt knowing doesnt decrease entropy
