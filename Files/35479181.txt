answer issues mentioned h3 starting application multiple times lead inconsistencies h3 lead inconsistencies multiple concurrent edit lead inconsistencies lock file editing easiest create lock file file starting edit check lock file exists make fault tolerant put timeout file lock file valid minutes write randomly generated uuid lockfile saving check uuid stil matches h3 users run application network drive experience concurrency issues h3 number h3 aborting write process lead corrupted data loosing data h3 solved making write atomic file immutable make atomic editing file directly copy file edit copy copy saved rename files safer side things append timestamp file edit delete file time edit made create copy newer timestamp appended file reading read newest
