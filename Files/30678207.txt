comparing list strings equal hashcode 
writing jee client server application requirement files present server match files present client validating exact match file names number files specific directory required efficient server make clients files assuming clients client server communication chatty current approach rest api rest client strong server strong ol li find list files target directory li li create checksum directory making hashcode derived file names summing number li ol strong clients strong ol li receiving request verify integrity target directory client takes checksum provided server runs algorithm generate checksum local directory li li checksum matches client responds server success li ol approach correct 

blockquote approach correct blockquote approach correct proposed implementation imo assume em summing em means hashcode values bit quantities assume filenames distributed uniformly means chance em em sets filenames hash calculated words hash collision algorithm wrong time billion times acceptable worse algorithm em trivially em manufacture situation set filenames algorithm wrong answer avoid problems longer checksums protect people manufacturing collisions cryptographically strong hash checksum md5 popular choice sending complete list filenames cheap hashcode based checksum hint directory contents em em makes sense depends
