parallel process elements list sum streams 
addition conmutative property sum objects serializable mode sum elements couples sum results sum part list sum results make effective parallel processing familiar api parallel streams snippet code started write dont continue 

operation parallel starts saving time working extremely large sets numbers smaller sets slower parallelization overhead code runs speed parallel operator lowering intcount paying 5ms iterations overhead parallelization machine lot time practically
