initialization costructor anonymous classes 
understand strange behavior faced dealing anonymous classes class calls protected method inside constructor poor design story class extends overrides code expected constructor super class invoked ctor anonymous class expect equal class compiler automatically creates class extends creates instance variables store local variables referenced methods anonymous class simulating closure run initially thinking due fact introducing lamdbas changed anonymous classes implemented hood longer result byte code difference replicate behavior anonymous class normal classes edit clarify question initialization anonymous classes break rules initializing class super constructor invoked setting variable set instance variable class inovking super constructor
