statements blocks code 
beginner programmer banging head wall assignment create program simulates car drive park fill thing litres gas tank hold litres tank asks user drive fill park grab user input depending user enters block code runs specific instructions drive enter amount km driven user inputs output litres gas amount gas remaining tank assume car average km fill user enter number litres add output number litres tank user input litres tank hold park output number litres tank total number km driven exits loop kind loop code run equation red underlined lines lost 

understand required post suggest corrections code ol li required finally print number kilometres run introduced variable initialised start loop li li stated post program loop till user exit loop choosing order loop introduced loop variable initialised start loop variable check condition finally close blocks results looping till user select li li suggest changed filter incorrect inputs users handled condition block li li required remove references program li li changed conditions compare input directly required require variables li li condition block require add line track kilometres run written equivalent li li require corrected line basically equality equation mathematics assignment operator programming track amount gas amount gas filled statement written equivalent li li require corrected mathematics equation make sense programming statement basically adding amount left tank li li write condition input requires input stated original post based input prints status km run litre tank variable results exiting li li finally put condition satisfy users input write message user loop li ol
