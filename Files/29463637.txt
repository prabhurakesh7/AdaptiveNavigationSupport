single threaded application starts threads 
experienced strange behaviour openjdk jvm starting single threaded application compute server jvm starts lot lot threads heavily increase cpu load processors dont suitable explanation image tested things ol li running amazon ec2 instance 200gb ram similar result number threads li li starting app smaller parameters changed li ol experienced behaviour explain happening img src http stack imgur e9xtq png alt http stack imgur e9xtq png strong edit strong things suggested valuable valuable output work suggests output main process doesnt output belongs kill jstack found tmux checked pids running processes generate high cpu load belong gc threads single threaded program generate garbage gc threads busy starting point fully explaining debugging code complex research project scope question directly topic adjust number gc threads jvm spawns start debugging garbage collection helpful tools hints 

answer give ol li answers imply real evidence wrong os level threads correspondence threads os threads linux current generation jvms li li jvms fault spontaneously create large numbers threads depending version jvm parameters ten internal threads idle time running time monitoring suggest li li fiddling heap stack size parameters wont affect number threads launched address problem li li running platform ec2 em em make difference li ol application party libraries provide details thread dump offer clues threads created hr suspiciously large heap large number cores apparently default policy throughput collector create gc thread physical core hard conceive case single threaded application create garbage large number gc threads busy extended period filled heap reachable objects
