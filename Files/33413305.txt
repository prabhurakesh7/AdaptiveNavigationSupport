algorithm sort list basis criteria 
list sort based criteria criterion lets represents timestamp order elements list groups single elements ordered descending basis timestamp basically expect result lets object list figured method make cycles make groups sorting elements finally merge lists efficient algorithm sorting lists basis criteria 

sort list directly custom comparison method checks criteria method pass custom comparator method overriden obsessed performance possibly speed percents sophisticated approach list hundred elements gains negligible optimized comparison method features conditional branches means faster naive version performance knew data instance big object small timestamps unique timestamps narrow range propose solution assume data arbitrary specific pattern solution standard sort utility shown splitting list sublists sorting separately slower sorting algorithm divide data groups recursively groups division wont follow criterion learn read href https en wikipedia org wiki quicksort rel nofollow quick sort href https en wikipedia org wiki merge sort rel nofollow merge sort work
