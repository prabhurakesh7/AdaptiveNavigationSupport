design pattern list store multiple types object integer 
guess design pattern hard time evaluate explain setup clear some1 experience ul li application starts create number objects class file li li lifecycle end application closed access application running class application li li check object attribute exists ul li lets objects user objects id amp check return user object id li ul li ul precise explanation startup ul li application database data roles tbl roles li li application creates objects class role data li ul user logs application ul li application database roles user li li application maps role objects user object user object list role objects stored li li order application access role objects created startup li ul read data database amp create objects data leaving function objects lifecycle stay till application closes working web application amp jsp amp apache shiro framework class runs application start thought reach line method prints list empty filled objects problem eyes main class function run lifetime application class servlet contributes servlet application store data multiple classes user session attribute application doent session guess strong solution strong solved part user strong issue strong thing list stores object multiple types list stores list integers list stores object class list integers lists strong issue strong ended trick basic setup integer list add integer values list causing errors error strong solution issue strong created list objects added lists type object filled lists data 

dont find design pattern store things list solve problem code problem problems application initialisation effect main part application receive control application container worth bearing mind jsp act main driver application event db update application context setup information state required threads order serve actions user strong edit strong comment worried scope work main access db build users map accessor return mutable view map read instance started application container lifetime objects references idea fairly rough edges illustrate worry terms keeping objects alive reference objects class instance application references compilation issues returned expected suggesting type description wanting check user id question list lists unnecessary clear goal bit fact kind thing means redesign solution bad attempting index lists based roles addroles method member object
