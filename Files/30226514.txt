avoiding diamond shapes composition inheritance 
building system classes class main method initialize show modify objects aforementioned classes understand inheritance adopt fields therapist patient classes person em address phonenumber em fields parent class composition theoretically build objects consultation bill patient class confused storing field called em therapist em therapist class showing call object patient included class diagram apparently forms diamond big whats class diagram work show store em therapist em therapist class em move em data member patient create objects heres diagram img src http imgur tsyx2kj png alt link 

diamond problem doesnt exist support multiple inheritance signature implementation works interface default methods havent messed diamond problem multi inheritance implementation languages refers problem class inheriting grandparent class parent classes instance youll grandchild distinct grandparent instances parent class results casting object grandparent depending parent cast youll single grandparent instance shared parents update grandparent semantics case add field add field called initialize constructor param setter problem bottom line diamond pattern multiple inheritance implementation doesnt support possibly excluding interface default methods diamond caused composition isnt antipattern pain making initialization disposal logic cumbersome
