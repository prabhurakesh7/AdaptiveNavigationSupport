identify stability types annotation processor 
write annotation processor generates source code based set javabeans properties processed types works general struggling correctly annotation processors specifically processor generate super class type processed processor super types properties account subsequent round super class super class generated means generate source code hierarchy type interested stable super types generated subsequent rounds round processor run processors find case aware possibility generating code final round understand bad practice compiler issue warning 

answer question annotated type considered stable complete super types erroneous lets assume annotation processor generates class case processor interested entirety hierarchy generate kind descriptor methods including inherited runs class exist examines hierarchy super class type mirror type kind indication defer handling round runs generate class leading processing round runs time process types deferred previous round exists type kind noticed javac important fresh representing type round reference erroneous super type erroneous super types hierarchy complete proceed handle processing deferred hierarchy finally complete super type generated compilation end error alright generate code case
