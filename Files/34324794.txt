briefly stumbled strong semaphores strong programming journey recently devise program replicating fast food chain explain comment section strong plan strong strong em producer em strong strong em consumer em strong tills worker tills order place buffer circular array worker processes order takes orders circular array implement semaphores order made specific till worker processed order semaphores officer order time strong main method strong main method looping running array threads worker tills tills class creates order fastfood semtills fastfood semtills semaphore acquiring semaphore releasing strong strong problem logic positioning semaphore downs ups worker class ensure worker process specific order time fine enable multiple workers enable multiple orders output waiting orders processed positioning semaphores wrong sorts possibilities quick class fastfood main creates threads buffer circular array order stores food till tills creates order worker processes order semaphore buffer change strong worker class strong tills class order 

reason releasing locks loop tills releasing check loop confusing till threads sleep order awoken order complete workers specifically work order shouldnt workers work order long orders waiting buffer post comments dont rep fast food buffer tills worker order class correct rid semaphore buffer made methods synchronized changed semaphore values fastfood run completely threads wake back join end exit program static variables totalorders processessorders control threads stop running threads copy lead race conditions wrong havent looked href https docs oracle javase tutorial essential concurrency rel nofollow good information
