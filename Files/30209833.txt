question big complexity nested loop sum operation end complications nested loop change big complexity 

big notation related programming language depends implementation irrelevant loops language optimizations performed interpreter compiler change program flow nested loop considered constant operation cost neglected outer loop stays roughly equal constant terms neglected asymptotic calculations loop takes steps finish step reduced half multiplying takes step em back em leads binary logarithm summary complexity edit funny thing loop real complexity division positive number greater wrong
