changing rate animation transition 
basic animations failing simple things problem facing click rectangle multiple times size randomly jump changing speed drops run size speed stop start jump totally size smaller lower speed bigger higher speed speed speed thought animation pre calculated speed jumped position played speed beginning time playing pause bigger smaller speed doesnt make sense change speed rate animation jump
