loop infinitely switch statement 
writing code quality tool scanning source compiled classes searching potential infinite loops souce code switch statement loop indefinitely wrong switch statements compile opcodes check compile classes security reasons bytecode modifications quality control program process compiled classes strong looping infinitely opcodes modifying class generating assembler strong care branching instructions statements appreciated edit conclusion suspected answers provided switch statement source code branch forward branching instruction bytecode potentially jump backwards assuming bytecode modifications 

blockquote looping infinitely opcodes modifying class generating assembler blockquote infinite loop backward modify byte code happen add change jump back loop infinite
