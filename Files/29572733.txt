implement generic linkedlist stack queue class 
project implement linkedlist data structure stack queue classes classes including linkedlist generic type problem bunch overflow nullpointerexceptions errors logistic stack queue classes supposed implement linkedlist class previously wrote runs flawlessly tested linkedlist time implementing linkedlistimplementation blueprints methods supposed addition files linkedlistimplementation linkedlist stack inside package called methods code runs flawlessly linkedlist class allowed libraries util constructed default behavior linkedlist stack queue supposed write logistic implementations simulating behavior implement stack comprised nodes implementing linkedlist attempt code approaching queue class stack running easy implement queue run code error assume error loop inside method kind class instantiating mistake code error line refers class constructor error line refers class constructor error line refers instantiation stack inside method line fourth error line refers call inside class default constructor correct approach achieving goal stack structure running linkedlist data structure lot time advance cheers hr edit1 push method wrong pop method pop method added correct corrected
