java3d sphere orbit 
looked find make sphere orbit central point 3d specifically make sphere circular motion origin constant speed loop forever guess equations blockquote originx sin angle size originy cos angle size blockquote positioninterpolator covers axis doesnt form circular orbit noticed transformation time spinning axis positioninterpolator transformations applied object 

code mess parts duplicated posting actual question true specific assemble multiple transformation rotation translation em single em work nicely predefined interpolators idea java3d strong scene graph based strong api assemble tree nodes node serves specific purpose case tree consist nodes make em structure code em resembles em structure graph em giving variable method names complete rotating object orbits center closely notice method method refers planet refers em translated em planet real application combined strong strong method hoped current form idea assembling nodes clearer hr blockquote edit extended based comments blockquote order add object moon rotates existing object iself rotating orbiting sun attach branch existing scene graph node based ascii art image youll attach node ttg node orbiting node translation node rotation node actual moon object img src http stack imgur cqswf gif alt orbiting intention build complete solar system introduce utility methods similar sketched extended
