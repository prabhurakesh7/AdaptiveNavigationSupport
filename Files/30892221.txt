dont time dig code ill answer remember gas blockquote give points produce function produce function depend deep initial trees blockquote whats question result select function distance points sum number points depending blockquote tree depth matter evaluate points produce satisfactory function blockquote tree depth affect things ul li accuracy higher depth accurate solution possibilities mutations li li performance depending tree higher depth increase performance allowing educated guesses function decrease requiring solutions generated compared li ul blockquote premature convergence ga breaks cycle blockquote due mutations set solutions converge local optimimum slight mutations move resulting solutions local optimum order break blockquote prevent premature convergence blockquote bigger mutations solutions start converge alternatively throw solutions mix immigration blockquote annealing blockquote annealing gradually improve solutions start converge point optimum youd improve solutions controlled random mutations break local optimum depending distributed ga solutions start converge annealing larger mutations completely solutions generate sets solutions approaches compare end create population convergence broken start iteration ga solutions converge optimum stop bigger improvement expected heuristic algorithms hit local optimum tradeoff provide performance accuracy
