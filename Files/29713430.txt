connection closed sleeping long durations httpclient requests 
apache httpcomponents specifically httpclient time fairly basic case polling party server seconds case api expecting post executing post requests loop noticed sleep longer duration minutes dont response back server connection dies consistently time dont server httpcomponents properly misconfigured set shorter duration minute works notice died running minutes fifteen minute intervals send request wrapped lambdas utilize resources dont matters actual exception 

common natural http servers close persistent connections idle maximum period inactivity order conserve resources case client generates request seconds server connection alive connection stays idle longer eventually closed server side half closed stale client side time client leases connection pool attempts execute request execution fails exception perfectly normal expected httpclient mitigate problem called stale connection check order find connection closed opposite endpoint invalid stale checks expensive sparingly httpclient version seeks improve performance box performing check selectively defect version basically disabled connection validation altogether upgrade version problem action case evict persistent connections connection pool prior long periods inactivity
