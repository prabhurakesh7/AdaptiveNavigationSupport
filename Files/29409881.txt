compare sets differrent types 
sets element types identical state relation element types standard guava apache commons implementation task element classes compare simplicity compare id field define interface comparison actual method comparing sets client code standard solution task suggestions improve code 

case sets sets hard compare top compare id proper solution normalize wanted values extract id sort ids compare em order em dont sort compare possibly skip pass duplicates values fact play lazy streams dont rush extracting sorting copying long lazyness fast compared iterative solutions generalize solution problem comparable mention guava dont algorithm
