generate random polygons desired locations 
generate random polygons asteroids game experimenting figure stuck finding positions start create angle length point polygon length depends randomly generated size asteroid fillpolygon requires points sorted angle loss math creating final point figuring coordinates point appreciated edit figured trig find length width point ratios ratios differ quadrant point 

assuming length youre generating distance origin asteroid length side give coordinates entry
