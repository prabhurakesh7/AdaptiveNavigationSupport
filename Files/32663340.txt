creating dungeons dragons dice roller 
tasked create dungeons dragons dice rolling program dice rolled highest numbers recorded lowest number put side program object oriented programming running problem additionally nested statements loops figure code class separately class run program asks person program sets dice theyd roll class represent set dice rolls class represent series dice rolled displaying dice rolled dice rolled lastly class handle rolling single die output show set dice rolled output main thing throwing create program required make nested statements loops 

solution problem completed classes main class dice class main class code prompt user input print dice rolls methods class constructor getter die dice constructor set roll dice object random number assuming d6 dnd rolls die created save needing call method roll die getter roll roll getter return roll member variable dice class hold random generated die suggest integers scanner users input dice sets rolled based input loop condition checked users input loop iterate set die user roll inside loop create objects iteration loop effectively give rolls die instantiated random number assuming give member variable hold dies dice class roll access dies dot notation output needing assign returned variable finally check roll lowest series statements check roll lowest suggest condition check dice2 lowest check dice3 check dice4 sudo code main class main class nested loops statements class started added bonus wanted program run user set die roll closed program wrap body starting prompt user input loop true creates infinite loop nested loops work solution loop program run terminate console running wanted satisfy requirements specific problem included loop hope helps mkreegs
