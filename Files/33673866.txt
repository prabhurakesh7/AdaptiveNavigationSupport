primitive data type int represents bit integer class single int property methods means integer class primitives scenes reason pure object oriented programming language stored primitives imagine pseudo class recursive programming language implemented primitives solving confusion 

ill rephrase question youre wrong feel free comment blockquote type system based composition inheritance define type intrinsic types start language implementation intrinsic type start defined types doomed recursive empty inevitable blockquote family language pretty inevitable type composed types intrinsic type build intrinsic type represents em bit em order construct em byte em type composition em word em type em integer em types youd define operations performed types manipulating bits make internal representation intrinsic type build terribly inefficient dont waste space cpu cycles advantage storage locations instructions target architecture offers including fp registers stuff good compromise performance purity offer language intrinsic types recognizable modern cpus em int32 em em int64 em em float em em double em build rest type system decided call intrinsic types em primitives em make separate classes
