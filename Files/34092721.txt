hailstone algorithm hard implement easier make recursive function natural writing iterative function causing issues started working hailstone implementation recursive function implement rest project requirements easily youve algorithm working id challenge convert working iterative function features correct write unit tests test program tdd dictates write tests write actual implementation great practice skipped due time constraints perception strong test suite overkill em hailstone em comments extra stuff
