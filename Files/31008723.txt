collision detection rectangles overlap libgdx 
weeks manage proper collision detection created maze rectangles object rectangle stop object collides wall move slide wall walls rectangles negative coordinates overlaps method found heres method collisionmanager class function saves position moves made object collision occurs object restores previous move move move collision occured additional information moving object stuck overlaps function found works cases object moves wall touches function returns true executed lets slide wall move directly walls object stops point detects collision bottom object top wall collision object left wall find solution object stop wall move slide wall suspecting collision walls nearby feel close solution bit extra strong update strong updated moveright function update function adrian shum matthew mark miller made integer meaning 01f 1f code move object collisionmanager class function em stopgoingright em good object collides wall object stops bounces back good problem irritating ill describe moving object wall object bounce back times wall stop pressing key object stay stuck wall happen press key itll press left object left overlaps function executed object wall intersect solve libgdx isnt perfectly suited handle kind collision detection deep building game 

finally found good solution link href http stackoverflow questions overlap player stuck libgdx rectangle overlap player stuck libgdx rectangle basically create fake move object collide wall collision stop object dont execute move everyones greatly appreciated
