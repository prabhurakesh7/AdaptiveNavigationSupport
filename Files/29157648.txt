cbc mac aes implementation extremely slow 
project implement function android generates cbc mac aes file basically function takes blocks file calculates identifier block finally combines identifier file function works great bigger files extremely slow minutes hours loops implemented knowledge cryptography doesnt improve speed output cbc mac libraries programming languages works limited external libraries class cbcblockciphermac bouncycastle include dependencies give output mentioned function feedback solve days figure update function str a32 loop looping bytes causing biggest speed problem function made faster solve problem looping bytes implementing cbc mac function cloud provider mega implemented code 

main suspect seek operation loop processing bytes dont algorithm code suggest reading full chunk process parts chunks sequential miss somehting reading sequentially seek dont bytearrayoutput stream helper method making substring impact calling tobytes string picking parts byte array efficient code roughly times faster original main method convert bytes string convert back byte begining str a32 byte method input read chunk process blocs bytes potentially problem code read bytes start padding contract read attempt made read len bytes smaller number read typically smaller number end file principle happen time start padding middle stream mess parts completely
