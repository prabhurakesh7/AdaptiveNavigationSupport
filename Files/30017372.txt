concurrent processing work newly instantiated objects works deserialized objects class 
perform concurrent calculation processing resources code instance class method creates number class instances submits instance expecting callbacks processing method class data processing object instances class retrieved file system serialized data exist initialized instances problem case object instances deserialized file system concurrent processing executes expect runs parallel processing cores occupying processing resources case object instances newly initialized concurrent processing execute expect runs single threaded execution occupying processing resources guess wrong newly initialized object instances dont wrong concurrency work works serialized deserialized versions hints ideas greatly appreciated 

whats making concurrent execution sequential computation lt ms guess deserialization time computation time longer ms deserialized objects scenario cpu activity youd effectively multiple tasks running time executor threads smaller timeout
