ray casting avoid drawing unseen faces 
creating voxel engine created chunk generation addition simple simplex noise integration extremely laggy due face quad drawn understanding commonly dealt ray casting understand basic theory draw rays camera check collision collision found face view therefor rendered understand theory havent implement due lack prior knowledge found internet lacking give code knowledge steps imagine ol li learn opencl havent understanding make graphics card kernels mentally associate opengl shaders li li learn theory math ray casting heard ray tracing li li learn information render hidden faces assuming working implementation telling opengl render hidden faces cube object knowledge manipulate faces object opengl vertices opencl communicate opengl opencl isnt graphics api isnt capable drawing rays li ol point direction pure opengl implementations opencl aspect learning experience
