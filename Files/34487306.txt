function loop space complexity 
guessing isnt reusing spot memory time making 

h2 h2 constant sized variables method allocate strong extra strong space means loop constant space complexity strong strong clarify question blockquote call iterative binary search space complexity algorithm blockquote absolutely function check preallocated list hash table iterative binary search preallocated sorted array constant space variables space complexity strong ps strong clarifying doubt raised op comments answer onwards pointed michaelrecachinas loop references copy wont contribute space complexity function strong pps strong allocated memory reused iteration loop
