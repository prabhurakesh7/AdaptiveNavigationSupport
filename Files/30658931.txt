programmatically perform feature detection 
id write framework supports baseline strong strong takes advantage features run context upwards compatible backwards baseline degrades gracefully support provide h3 attempt h3 thought address similar manner feature detection programmatically test presence method exists programmatically invoke fallback libraries imo arduous approach itd great feature toggling detection handled taking crazy pills strong disclaimer strong havent addressed compilation rule usefulness solution compile add compiled classes
