lets list strong strong numbers allowed choose strong strong integers lets call integer strong strong integer strong strong delete number inclusive range strong strong strong strong number minimum strong strong list cleared list numbers answer pick integers clear list deletes number solve solution related dynamic programming brute force method solution code helpful preferably 

recursive solution estimation split groups estimated greather lower element estimated solution solution lower extimated groups check group repeat recursively problem decreasing group solution thereis discard worse solution strong edit strong long numbers version main idea search islands distances split problem islands divide conquer distribute islands
