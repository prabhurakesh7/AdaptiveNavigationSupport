significant performance difference 
stumbled thought case branch misprediction href http stackoverflow questions processing sorted array faster unsorted array case explain branch misprediction phenomenon implemented versions bubble sort performance tests difference sorting methods running program expect slower similar output machines set parameter expected results ported program determine problem specific code program shows behaviour explain executing change results
