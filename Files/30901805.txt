spawn random objects overlapping 
developing game part requires objects spawn top screen proceed fall objects possibly spawn coordinates spawn stored array called br objects class called inherits class called fallingthings class methods generate objects enemy method represents index xcoordinates array br indexes array objects comparisons values ensures object spawn directly top br variable represents random delay objects spawn set earlier main class br store instance object works fact object spawn delay enemy objects spawn directly top proceed fall speed time crack past days understand code isnt working properly implementing collision detection check object exists space didnt work extremely grateful suggestions ideas 

strong edit2 strong dont understand problem function addressed answer ill make clear wrong set index index youre generating index elegant solutions job problem setting index back generate index index indexmoney indexfriend indexold indexmoney indexfriend generate index instance indexmoney condition fail recursive call recursive call oldindex call youre setting indexold indexmoney indexfriend problem overlapped index wrong index matter recursive calls takes youre shooting foot recursive call result infinite loop stack overflow youre changing index wrong place condition making newly generated index overlap previous indexes simplify function work avoid overlapping delaytimer dont rest code suggestions alternatives generate index wanted assuming fit code youre free youve fixed actual problem hr strong original answer strong heres suggestion thing enemies borrow elements array array select indexes youre maximum size array remove element choose removing index options youre time passed enemy dies put back array dont bother checking indexes general idea suggestion adapt make work specifically place back array dont code hr strong edit strong alternative array previously remove values coordinate create extra array values values wont overlap objects youre index youre check overlaps downside create extra array makes conditions simpler keeping random code answers comments refer single instance remember
