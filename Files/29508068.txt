efficiently filter collect resulting map differently derived map values maps 
objects keyed type differently typed values purpose question share supertype create resulting map type filtering maps differently mapper map values commonly typed values maps helper method perform steps current cases make assume em em filtering map give distinct keys final object keys map event hold true future provide supplementary expression handle properly final code reads strong question strong efficient sounds case reducing stuff filtered maps final collection requires reduction invocations mapping part approaching correct guess implement parent method problem reduced applying forms filtering maps simpler solution em alternate assumption em feel free mention 

change method perform operation single operation small number input maps number grows approach shown preferable wouldn expect noticeable performance gain approach verify assumption duplicate keys remaining entries
