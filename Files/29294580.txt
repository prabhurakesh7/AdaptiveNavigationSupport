implement sync async methods library 
make library synchronous asynchronous feature ul li waits result returns result li li returns future immediately processed things needed li ul strong core logic library strong customer library call passing builder object construct url object make http client call url executing response back json string send json string back customer creating object customer call call method provide method separately library interface implements interface simple class perform actual task customer company library shown factory code base implement sync async method library implementing bad idea consume thread thread pool call currrent setup explain bad idea performance issue implement sync async method criteria library heavy load fast meaning time server taking respond code base async blocking architecture 

creating thread case synchronous operation required lead performance hit basically creating thread read wasting resources benefits wrap http part class code http access synchronous asynchronous case client implementation simply class http implementation completely separate future change receive strong dataresponse strong db call change httpaccess class part affected
