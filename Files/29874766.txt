share understanding properties hope advice wrong tells percentage reducers heap memory allocated circular buffer store intermedite outputs copied multiple mappers tells maximum percentage memory buffer single shuffle output copied single map task shuffles size size copied memory buffer directly written disk reducer tells threshold percentage memory merger thread run merge shuffle contents memory buffer single file immediately spills merged file disk memory merger thread require atleast shuffle files present memory buffer initiate merge time higher single shuffle file memory controlled property mandates aleast shuffle file present buffer merge process
