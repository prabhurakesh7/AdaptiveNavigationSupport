square subsequences 
question string called square string obtained concatenating copies string abab aa square strings aaa abba string subsequences string square strings subsequence string obtained deleting characters maintaining relative order remaining characters input format line number test cases test cases follow case string output format output lines test case required answer modulo constraints lowercase characters sample input sample output code passed test cases recursions large strings taking secs generate answer test cases passed initially intend derive sequences check derived sequence square sequence give idea solve generating sequence 

basic idea arrange squaresequences derived inputstring tree graph basically trees merged multiple parents allowed trees locally longest squaresequences root leaves squaresubsequences length derived rootsequence simplest finding subsequences simply traverse tree count nodes hard find locally longest squaresequences input option start leaves traverse longest sequences found easily simply searching squaresequences length relationship squaresequences theory praxis br position characters inputstring relevant differ sequences differ sequences produce string subsequences represented br step finding squaresubsequences length basically find permutations indices length indices point equivalent chars inputstring sequences found rest pretty forward squaresubsequence length produced merging sequences sequence squaresequences derived merging sequences merging operation simplified work sequence length parameter valid subsequence consists number squaresequences ensure find squaresequences simply finding combinations squaresequences notes method print sequences code optimized plenty ways simple
