trouble recursive overloading 
studying basic question programming assignment lot trouble recursive overloading sort search method heres asked write method accepts dimensional int array parameter searches legal paths starting ending end array instance array declared end order path legal jumps performed cells end array reached path doesnt end end array isnt legal heres img src http stack imgur kaywt jpg alt logic jump performed 10s 1s place number cell vice versa goal method return number legal pathways exist array wouldnt problem wasnt fact professor requirements assignment absolutely loops method carried completely recursion global constant variables changing contents array duplicating creating methods overloading encouraged required point writing method assist process question heres apologize long question stuck thing week havent figure array photo give result paths time run method greatly appreciated 

fixed code essentially id problem wrong missing case check outcomes subsequent recursion method ol li end array reached returned li li jump tens place place legal reverse true li li jump place tens place legal reverse true li li aforementioned jumps legal li ol realized write series cascading statements return recursive function didnt understand return statement recursive call enables run method case simultaneously divide conquer sort resulting code ran method countpaths int array array picture posted original question returned result correct answer special imchpers helped code weeks ago hope answer helps struggling kinds recursive functions language
