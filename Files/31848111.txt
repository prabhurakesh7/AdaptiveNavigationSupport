factorial code recursion run program logic enters fact function num skip step confused execute step logic call fact function control program reaches start fact function num skip call fact function executing syntax amp reaches start fact method num time num matched amp returned return happen correction dont understand flow recursion program 

hit stop condition keeping mind fact statement early method replacing element recursion repeatedly dive deeper process stop condition encountered case num
