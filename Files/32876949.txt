reason spring async external calls 
async applied method making external call tomcat request thread handle incoming request external service returns thread pool theoretically external service returns threads strong strong busy wait free thread means async slower case benefits async confirm understanding 

calling method doesnt free tomcat thread combine asynchronous method run thread separate pool configurable spring original thread freed process request tomcat thread pool processing shorter lived types request requests processed waiting slow external request complete benefit requests frequent intensive theyre maxing tomcat thread pool youre performance issues async threads hand tomcat request threads firing external calls asynchronously tomcat pool exhausted hit limits advantage case requests parallel threads tomcat thread pool assumes free tomcat thread youre cases ul li make multiple external requests run parallel significant time execute github api href https spring io guides gs async method rel nofollow spring guides li li significant processing locally external request execute parallel case fire request local work wait request finish li ul
