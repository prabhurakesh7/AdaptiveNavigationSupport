stack variable collection holds integers int variable sort numbers stack solve post ideas strong create variable code snippet collections sort strong 

terribly inefficient respects rules strong edit strong basically advantage fact extends dont standard methods access remove elements normal methods squeeze purposes times exit flag loop index temp storage reorder bad programming practice algorithm basically loop stack elements time find element greater remove place end stack moment stop loop reset make start loop loop stack items needing reorder strong edit strong alternative bit complicated read respects rules performs bubble sort pattern principles pretty attempt abusing variable multiple strong edit strong revised algorithm bitwise complement operator point unlike clever attempts algorithm doesnt limitations wont potentially suffer recursive calls recursion memory stable negative work fine
