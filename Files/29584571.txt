fastest iterate ordered pairs hashmap entries 
code time process ordered pairs data structure wondering improve iteration time idioms welcomed thought logic condition expressed lambda notation data stored sorted iteration faster factor time complexity strong edit strong found soluttion preserves order months inserted pairs 

time complexity identical specifically blockquote blockquote blockquote blockquote complexity class mathematically provable fact true greater characterization big notation explaining thing cost sorting list saving include cost calculations hr gut feeling implementing alternatives larger application em measuring em performance advice ordinary complexity analysis takes quickly realm behaviours specific library methods compilers etcetera afaik em practical em answers rely empirical measurement em profile em application make arent wasting time optimizing significant impact em em performance hr latest comments thrown multi threaded performance complicated problem
