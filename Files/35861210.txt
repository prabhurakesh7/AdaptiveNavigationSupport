sum infinity algorithm acceptable 
sum infinity series found explanation scientist em infinity point point existent strong inf inf strong strong inf inf strong em based theory algorithm algorithm run strong strong strong strong gave output strong em inf em strong print statements written strong strong strong strong hr strong edit strong code mistake solved heres code id base question hr friend mine output finite fractional number strong strong case program terminated strong strong strong strong em output edited code posted previous faulty code output inf em question algorithm acceptable id outputs strong strong 

blockquote algorithm run gave output inf blockquote bug code starting calculate inf series supposed start edited question fix bug correct sum infinity series diverges infinity calculating eventually reach point small change break loop expect happen didnt run bug code reached wrap start adding em negative em terms sum oops hr calculate harmonic series partial sums terms converge log euler mascheroni constant source href https en wikipedia org wiki harmonic series 28mathematics partial sums rel nofollow https en wikipedia org wiki harmonic series 28mathematics partial sums estimate difference nth partial sum large stop iteration final accurate sums sum opposite direction starting large summing reducing
