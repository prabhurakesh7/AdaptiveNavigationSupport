image processing noise reduction vector median processing 
task create vector median filter clean noisy images logic isnt complex level paying field images 3d arrays values red green blue values stored sort row column situation works liks referencing pixel values show exact pixel specific spot image imagine square resembles matrix filter scholarly article filter performs linear filtering moving window mask target pixel rgb values resets pixel pixel smallest sum distance pixels window havent image processing work confusing pretty straight forward mask essentially box moves image creates neighborhood pixels size predetermined constraint 3x3 neighborhood ill values code gist choose target pixel neighborhood generally center examples center calculate based surrounding pixels pretty easy impressive eliminating noise images logic creating pixel important part neighborhood values fairly easy include issue calculating logic correctly logic stated compares neighborhood pixel creates running sum distance pixel relative rest pixel running sum lowest target pixel steps follow code examples ol li neighborhood values li li perform distance calculations pixel neighborhood relative pixels neighborhood store running sum absolutes distance formula li li making complicated messing logic fund lowest running sum set target pixel compare individual running sum values verify lowest lowest target pixel long apologize li li return image li ol fairly neighborhood correct algorithm find neighborhood filter works flawlessly problem essentially code reducing noise fact image makes sense theoretically changing pixel advice isnt specific question advance entire method suggested updates
