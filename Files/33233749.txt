double precision discrepancy 
writing code languages involves double precision arithmetic ideally programs yield values aware double float arithmetic deterministic explained nicely href https randomascii wordpress floating point determinism rel nofollow https randomascii wordpress floating point determinism carefeful explain program result equivalent program result results feeling related floating point rounding modes defaults ensure programs result em edit em fwiw print constant bigdecimal em em prove display issue magic jvm underneath em edit2 em chris suggests annotated class result remains em edit3 em suggestion result 

display issue precision specifier allowing precision increased point prints trailing digits dont care printed extract sign mantissa exponent print prints equivalent code works gcc x86 machine produces output shows internal representation constant platforms universally true architectures implementations discrepancy output original programs due differences implementation functions version apparently stops calculating digits point prints 0s possibly avoid printing floating point constants differently written source code hand em calculated em constant difficult time match
