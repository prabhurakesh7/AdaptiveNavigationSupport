design problem create constructors set object random values fields goal questionable design objects assignment mind objects designed represent real world entities generally constructors predictable result set reasonable defaults values provided design randomness plain constructors accept values callers design separate method generate random values populating array specific task means constructors validate values acceptable parameter passed constructor valid constructor constructor throws exception commonly exception doesnt declared clause constructor lets start class doesnt args constructor time reasonable defaults create age mandatory checking age reasonable limits human null parameters reasonable exception thrown object creation fail move student human age started studying notice pass age test constraint em em em em instruction constructor doesnt matter object allocated allocation part current object age super constructor couple assignments destroyed turns age illegal student waste avoided checks fields assignments generate proper random student assignment create static method assignments create classes writing current assignment class class add class static array names add object student generation internally declare static factory method static methods generating instances class called static factory methods naively approach generate random ages years pass constructor catch exception succeed generating good result bad create tons objects fail succeed lots time catching mechanism heavier looping general case thrown means checked em em passing true case make send reasonable values exception em em values reasonable extend ranges choice entire legal range simply picked values nice centenarian students students started studying reagan era call factory method times fill list random students generating method separate constructors youll classes future tasks rely random generation fill values database
