slow connect cassandra cluster datastax driver 
set cassandra cluster nodes servers identical hardware configuration internal network recently works cqlsh perfect code datastaxs website write code work cluster problems program works connects cluster successfully writes reads data connection slow deployed code machine cluster node resides takes seconds connect precisely line em session cluster connect em takes time setup cassandra cluster node network similar hardware configuration takes connect missed configurations writing code spend time searching answer seconds connection time hard replacement current database addition ping time machines 1ms dont networks problem cqlsh connect cluster fast cassandra version maven dependency datastax enlighten takes long connect cluster nodes code connect cassandra cluster basically shown website 

found reason slow simply set em rpc address em cassandra yaml set ip address connection time dropped seconds rpc address affects node discovery time significantly
