finding minimal factorization int square numbers 
strong problem solve strong return minimal factorization numbers squares br define factorization usual manner factorization numbers optimal solution square minimal numbers hr strong attempt solve strong idea number perform algorithm br find closest square number find br compute recursively number minus square closest br flow assume function compute union union union list square combinations minimal list save hashmap avoid duplications dynamic programming style code attempt incomplete hr strong question strong solution optimal imo time complexity solution maximal recursion depth maximum number children solution full bugs doesnt matter moment guidance find optimal solution pseudo code
