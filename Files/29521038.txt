set capacity vert http request queue 
written vert http server client sends requests faster server process server side request queue slowly fills eventually jvm runs memory accumulating requests set capacity vert request queue set ul li maximum number queued requests li li maximum size bytes queued requests li ul limits violated incoming request immediately respond 

afaik built accomplish type back pressure achievable normal means approach ul li http requests received immediately forward request message separate request handling verticle event bus increment outstanding request counter li li perform request handling logic verticle respond event bus message complete li li http server verticle receives response request handler verticle decrement request counter send response li li add request counter check http server handler check outstanding request count respond error queue grows large li ul common pattern vert essentially separates request handling logic http request handler forwarding request event bus jsonobject ensures requests quickly queued event bus queue calculate number outstanding requests shown scale http server multiple verticle instances order handle requests case static variables shared data share semaphore instances
