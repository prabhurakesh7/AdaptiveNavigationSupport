thread immediately update ui 
javafx application visualizes compuational geometry algorithms execution algorithm thread lets call algorithm update ui time adding removing modifying shapes code method update ui immediately prevent calling thread running marked ui update thought boolean guards code hope idea curious solution problem 

strong simple approach block background thread update complete strong update ui fx application thread typically passing plain wait ui update complete proceeding create href http docs oracle javase docs api util concurrent futuretask html rel nofollow pass call block task complete lets handle tricky work waiting notifying higher level api kind work refactor utility method similarly daineschs answer strong alternative approach ensure update consumed frame rendering blocking background thread update pending strong approach create capacity hold update ui background thread submit blocking queue blocking queue hold element block pending execute updates queue remove added background thread code create timer consume updates basically ensures update scheduled time background thread blocking pending updates consumed animation timer checks blocking pending updates frame rendering ensuring update executed nice thing approach increase size blocking queue effectively keeping buffer pending updates ensuring update consumed single frame rendering occasional computations longer computations chance calculated waiting executed
