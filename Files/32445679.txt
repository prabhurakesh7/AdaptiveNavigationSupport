3d collision detection jbullet 
spent long time work collision detection system scratch game engine fruitless due lack time finally decided jbullet make things quicker documentation basically useless difficulty transfer bullet code transfer working ripping hair search library code time saving hoping useless explain guys simple collision detection hit print line rest work create world entity class class stores info physics object attached entity simply entity getphysics getcollisionobject setposition create collisionobject class converts made mesh render entity vector3f lwjgl library jbullets vector3f creates convexhullshape vertices mesh supposed kind simplify mesh documentation create collision object pretty simple create rigidbody rigid body collision object true great game loop forgot basically happening add objects manifold dont edit create collision shape random sized box create ghost body return hit edit create object entity class update position stuff physicsentity class set 

experience bullet limited object affected gravity correctly collision callback called problem doesnt move wont move mass static object mass kinematic call static kinematic objects detect collisions dynamic objects mass greater suggest simple collision shape begin sphere verify simulation works convex hulls tricky start simple produce working collision detection method call forces applied collision detection resolution iterate check objects collided simulation step call collisions detected solved standard cases exceptions soft bodies clothes ghost objects detect collisions reactions edit situation collision needed hit detection dont static dynamic kinematic case detects collisions doesnt react easily check overlaps calling edit2 create object correctly assuming transformations correct object overlap missing missed glimpse create object dont add world bullet engine aware existence edit3 suggestions make collision detected physics objects ghosts rigid bodies created added world collision detected bullet wont collide physics object scene geometry physics object post code creating moving objects editn youve posted functions creating physicsentity idea entities create parameters neccessary check world coordinates verify collide usage quaternion bit disturbing pass arguments rotation axis works advise constuctor takes rotation axis angle parameters code problem complex direct reason code youve posted advise debugger step code object initialized correctly positions expected finally step collision code doesnt happen
