java8 stream reduce parameters transparency 
wrote code reduce list words long count words start writing learn id understand em disclaimer realize write code practice em middle parameter lambda called accumulator capable reducing full list final combiner parameter fact javadoc blockquote code accumulator function acts fused mapper accumulator efficient separate mapping reduction knowing previously reduced avoid computation blockquote strong edit author strong statement wrong dont confuse keeping dont ruin original context answers infer accumulator outputting 1s 0s combiner combines didnt find documentation strong question strong output combiner executes list 1s 0s combiner combines helpful debugging complex situations ill eventually 

combiner reduce list 0s 1s stream run parallel case loop equivalent run stream parallel task spanned multiple threads data pipeline partitioned chunks evaluate produce result independently combiner merge results wont list reduced values identity computed task summed add print statement combiner blockquote helpful debugging complex situations ill eventaully blockquote generally data pipeline debugger applied output blockquote disclaimer realize write code practice blockquote idiomatic achieve task stream simply hope helps
