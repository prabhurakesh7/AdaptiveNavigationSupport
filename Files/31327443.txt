doesnt channelread give full message send server fragmentation occur messages bytes roughly tcp socket nioserversocketchannel class beta5 isnt read full message arrived class testserverhandler extends channelinboundhandleradapter full bytebuf bytearray fully arrived server notified application respond correct data client send short prevent fragmentation channelread event output message bytebuf 

basic data type netty channel buffers bytebuf simply collection bytes code simply custom handler handle raw incoming data generally good practice basic netty pipeline img src http stack imgur lhy4x png alt enter image description pipeline consists decoder encoder custom handlers logging handlers handle raw data tcp stream protocol identify specific packet ends packet starts send large packet individual packets simply treated set bytes read raw set bytes strong fragmentation strong happen properly implement channel pipeline consists string decoder encoder problem
