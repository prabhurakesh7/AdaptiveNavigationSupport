blockquote 1a definitions correct blockquote completely definition declaring type variable wrong shouldnt compile blockquote 1b complete compareto method blockquote depends youre supposed comparing havent dont blockquote literature found online referenced compareto method make sense blockquote heres typically compare nodes delegates data dont care data null implements blockquote swap nodes singly linked list implementation swap method inherently require doubly linked implementation linked list blockquote hint dont swap nodes data
