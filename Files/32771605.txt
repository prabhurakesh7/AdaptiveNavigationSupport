base64 binary streams 
feel answer suppose scala libraries completely base strings output match net output assume sort byte ordering issue havent luck correct blockquote pczmzt3mzm0 gaaapczmzqaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad3mzm0 gaaaaqaaaabrn8xzaaaaaaaaaaeaaaaaaaaaaq blockquote unknown signs chop reasons blockquote zczmpc3mzd0aaia zczmpqaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam3mzd0aaia afpfn1ebaaaaaqaaaa blockquote feel byte ordering code order method change ordering success clarity code running x86 centos net x86 windows server net values coming protobuf objects pretty cross platform numerically data identical consistent put write data types significant difference lack unsigned type binary representation difference initially resolve figure format option binary data written base encoded result results net serialization choices option resource aid bringing means binary manipulation byte data explanation datatypes searched significantly found resource explaining real differences implement solution decided 

main problem writes data types low bytes javas writes high bytes write net unsigned integer writes bytes write writes bytes difference fixing match hard understand differences code snippets encode information output encoded string case chose override writes strong net code sample strong pre class lang cs prettyprint override strong code sample strong pre class lang prettyprint override strong output samples strong blockquote yvbkwwaaaad ahj aaaaaoj9aad blockquote make test edge cases type make adjustments matters expect funny values differences dont care expect work fine
