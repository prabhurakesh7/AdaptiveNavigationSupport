minimax algorithm bug 
learn minimax algorithm stumbled bug figure solve code relevant part code generates move board called fields calculates score move proceeds make move results highest lowest score highest lowest bug occurs player starts takes field middle ai acts players turn ai starts act strange player chooses ai acts nomally dont wrong understood minimax algorithm correctly edit added code problem 

misunderstanding ahead game total values returned pseudocode minimax score tic tac toe board return notion key difference version version version strong recursive strong level deep mine calls inside infinite loop arent careful board fills deeper infinite difference totals stuff shouldnt resulting score tic tac toe youve looked end game picking move player time ignoring possibilities completely care line play game score equal result optimal play expanding messy minimax negamax cleaner white prefers low scores black prefers high scores statements make choose preferred score part end move code evaluated inside recursion end
