type model youve chosen core problem essentially takes type parameter makes difficult treat builders generically effect operate input domain youre telling compiler make pass dont compile makes sense youre collection builders essentially thing youre em runtime em protection problem doesnt solve em compile time em issue collection things potentially mix types pass collection builders defined subset types couple solutions theyll turn similar straight forward option change interface defined type method fact expecting compiler pass object safety checks runtime put safety cast youd change interface effectively method stands theoretically simply ignore pass wrong type solution change change existing
