hashset find common elements comparable arrays 
strong edit strong method signature wrong changing ide messes feel knowledge dont fully understand sets 2d array messing badly required write algorithm takes strong comparable strong arrays iterates strong linear time efficiency strong displays common elements read hashset give fastest time efficiency reached impasse heres instructions single line code method signature means return 2d array collections emailed prof hashsets ahead problem hashsets inside findcommonelements method count number comparisons performed hashing efficient comparisons made event collisions access source code hashset getcomparisons method commonelements class return number comparisons semesters programming learn hashsets maps tables learn fully understand collisions code arrays return common elements return statement screwy basically wrote compile 2d comparable array parameter path code 

strong edit strong forgot mention imported apache commons array utils figured main method calls instance class times test methods irrelevant giving trouble works
