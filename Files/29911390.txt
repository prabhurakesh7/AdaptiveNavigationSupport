configuring random number generators multi threaded environment 
application pseudo random numbers testing application reproducibility arrange seed random number generator rng declared inside class static variable questions ol li seed rng reproducibility make sense declare variable li li add classes random numbers move rng separate class seed application singleton object li li decide random numbers multiple threads strategy lose predictability order threads access rng rng generate predictable sequence random numbers run program thread grabs nth random number sequence differ li li thread rng order results reproducible runs thread seed guarantee reproducibility eliminate randomness introduced multiple threads li li generate seeds single number minimizes correlation rngs li ol words thread thread seed random numbers thread highly correlated seeds couldnt associate run program single number passed command line 

give thread random object avoid unreproducable interleaving due thread timing seed number exact sequence numbers dont problem problem master random object generate seeds time create thread seed master make create threads retrieve seeds order time
