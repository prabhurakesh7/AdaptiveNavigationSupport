memory complexity fibonacci sequence algorithm 
recently technical interview asked memory complexity algorithm wrote whiteboard specific remember correctly referring heap space heap space sounds giving clue wanted give complexity line code remember learning school allocates storage heap assuming memory serves correctly lets back question memory complexity supposed 

interviewer wanted understood consequences code wrote usual potential memory problem tail call recursive code recursive call takes stack frame garbage collected call including recursive subcalls completed stack frames allocated heap recursion deplete heap memoization shortcut saves retrieves calculated fibonacci numbers memory complexity calculating nth fibonacci number create recursive tree stackframes proportionate square recalculated numbers branches tree posted code shouldnt calculate fibonacci number total number stackframes explode worst case array initially empty array populated point amounts single array lookup
