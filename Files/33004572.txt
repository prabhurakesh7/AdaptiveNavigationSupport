performance memory consumption class array 
interest recently encountered situation projects store data dimensional array make dedicated class instances put dimensional array exist canonical design advice topic terms performance runtime memory consumption regard design patterns extremely simplified situation lets store data versus em em array based approach compact memory faster access arrays objects array access check indexes object member access allocation object array longer iteratively create instances code bigger due additional class designs common jvms provide advantages approach terms access speed memory consumption 

blockquote arrays objects blockquote approach buy route flatten dimensional array objects takes slots give access fields objects follow pointers thing big memory allocation component type primitive object memory allocation concerned container array motivations people href http stackoverflow questions structs types cs included wanting structs types similar considerations drive development specialized high performance data structure libraries rid unneccessary object wrappers worry huge datastructure overhead object oriented matter
