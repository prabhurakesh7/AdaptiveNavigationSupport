make loop iteration wait repaint method complete 
searching answer lots threads similar issues dont find solution fits basically loop id wait repaint method complete iteration loop starts detail segments drawn paintcomponent method em mappanel em class extends em jcomponent em user clicks button algorithm starts searching intersections beginning upper segments endpoints event points algorithm basically loop spoke calls algorithm loop sending event point iteration event points order top bottom id show current position algorithm drawing line current event point algorithm finds intersections id show draw needed paintcomponent method problem call repaint method mappanel inside loop waits loop end ui updated found lot fix case explanations heres actual algorithm
