algorithm subset array target sum giving working 
problem unsorted array give subsets array produce target sum strong expected results strong results sorted simplicity requirement naive approach problem simple brute force reasons expecting results browsing code dig issues find algo experts point correct direction results input 

solution wrong greedy approach decides add number based fact adding violate sum moment greedy approach work simple array element choose outer loop add current set deny possibility sum br choose start adding number starting adding added correct solution strong strong double loop approach generate subsets exponential number subsets wrong hr subsets sum sum recursive solution step guess current element set recurse options smaller problem data set simple code subsets exponential number inefficient exponential time solution expected hr finding set exist finding set efficiently dynamic programming href http stackoverflow thread explains logic br problem np hard efficient solution pseudo polynomial
