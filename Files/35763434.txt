large arraylist slow traversal time 
em solution arraylist filled duplicates modified code filter reduced running times em working algorithms project requires large amounts data program potentially large arraylist element traversed elements calculated elements added arraylist larger program run arraylists running time approximately seconds lt open ways traverse arraylist completely data structure dont care order values inside lists long values fast linked list significantly slower snippet code give understanding code find single digit permutations prime number edit removed unnecessary code snippet created currsize variable stops program call size current time difference idea arraylist grows
