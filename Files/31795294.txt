calling methods objects times 
structure parent children class stuff render drawing yellow circle green text displaying image thing entity bs cs render method renders 60x call render method object imagine objects call method 60x find bad practice dont solve dont loop solution ideas thinking implementing child classes methods looped call parent render method stick fact loop times short period time long time progress stuck long time solve 

primary concern rendering rendering entities child entities research general graphics programming optimizations tricks rendering engines improve performance big gain performance rendering engines work mentioned determine changed state render check bounds view bounds entity graphics canvas render things bounds 2d 3d things overlapping determine entities occluded avoid rendering child entities bounds parent avoid rendering entire tree object graph avoid iteration elements things partials checking part entity rendered part occluded require api pass bounds entities expected render entire graphics context item dont renderable entities dirty state bounds stuck iterating invoking render
