force spark execute code 
force spark execute call map thinks executed due lazy evaluation put map call doesnt trick map method uploads results hdfs useless spark thinks 

lets review strong rdd operations strong rdds support types operations transformations create dataset existing actions return driver program running computation dataset transformation passes dataset element function returns rdd representing results hand action aggregates elements rdd function returns final result driver program parallel returns distributed dataset transformations spark strong lazy strong em compute results em remember transformations applied base dataset file strong em transformations computed action requires result em strong returned driver program design enables spark run efficiently realize dataset created map reduce return result reduce driver larger mapped dataset default transformed rdd recomputed time run action persist rdd memory method case spark elements cluster faster access time query support persisting rdds disk replicated multiple nodes h2 conclusion h2 force spark execute call map youll require result action sufficient h2 reference h2 ul li href https spark apache org docs latest programming guide html rel nofollow spark programming guide li ul
