loop termination expression speed 
program loop roughly size list isnt changing accelerate loop replacing termination expression loop variable blockquote idea size arraylist possibly change iterating termination expression executed loop cycle jvm doesnt size stay constant usage variable speed things blockquote solution slower slower making mylistsize final doesnt change understand speed didnt change jvm found size doesnt change optimized code slower rewrote program size list cycle remove element list add element end list operation called iteration guessed dont correct termination expression faster variable remains constant time termination expression ideas edit hope test program performance posted code average executions 4102ms mylist size 4230ms mylistsize statements constant mylist size 172ms mylist size 329ms mylistsize speed versions version parts percentaged differences smaller lot time invested add remove operations list 

problem line change lo behold running times identical comparing iteration requires widening conversion takes time difference largely completely disappears code compiled optimised jmh benchmark results heres benchmark code strong strong blockquote idea size arraylist possibly change iterating termination expression executed loop cycle jvm doesnt size stay constant usage variable speed things blockquote assumption wrong reasons vm easily determine escape analysis list stored doesnt escape method free allocate stack importantly list shared multiple threads potentially modified run loop absence synchronization perfectly valid thread running loop pretend havent happened
