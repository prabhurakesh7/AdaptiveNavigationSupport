purpose passing parameter synchronized block 
blockquote synchronize block code objects lock lock party object lock piece code ability lock code synchronization single object blockquote dont understand passing argument block doesnt matter pass strings instance random classs instance synchronized block synchronized block works perfectly irrespective parameter passed block question strong synchronized block stops threads entering critical section simultaneously passing argument acquire lock random object default strong hope framed question correctly random parameters synchronized block static synchronized block static synchronized block 

blockquote synchronized block stops threads entering critical section simultaneously passing argument blockquote synchronized block decides threads stop based object pass object pass serves identifier critical section guarded synchronized block critical sections program executed concurrently unrelated collections accessed concurrently set separate critical sections collection threads stopped threads accessing collection threads accessing collections allowed proceed concurrently trivial reason works string object initialized string literal due literals interning threads entering function obtain object synchronized block properly guard critical section
