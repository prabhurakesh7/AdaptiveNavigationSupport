binary search tree class remove search insert remove iterator methods iteration recursion 
recently begun studying learning binary trees application utilize found binarytree class online wanted implement began simply creating header header implemted class methods programming knowledge ended creating works perfectly feel free test methods main class youd perform function concern strong efficiency strong searching online friend learned called recursion programming knowledge learning python encountered concept understand solution iteration learned binary trees iteration terrible inefficient reading questions pages understand recursion explain concept show application remove insert iterator search methods program faster learner application concept helps recursive solution functions understood concept applying difficulties apply concept remove insert search iterator methods 

basic idea recursion apply function smaller problem return results back call stack terms trees search method result checking current nodes data left subtree element subtree element likewise insert compare node element recursively insert left assign leaf node hit null node terms efficiency recursion overhead placing calls stacktrace potentially yielding stackoverflow iteration easier debug idea entire process step tail recursion improves efficiency dont applies binarytree methods implementations similar runtime efficiency written correctly imo recursion cleaner problem defined hr recursion implement binarytree method left complexity reasons added
