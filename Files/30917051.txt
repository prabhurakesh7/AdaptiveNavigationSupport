unmarshall xml file generated class structure jaxb running perplexing issue classloader hand apparently find classes instantiate schema classes manually search supplied classloader needed classes method creates urlclassloader loading specific jars needed generated classes setting system classloader parent generated classes postgresql libraries put classloader resource issue jaxb correctly finds objectfactory class supplied package instantiation generated classes problem result running code manual call works fine logs statement found class exceptions thrown instantiated throws cnfe exact resource stack trace idea whats wrong impression jaxbcontext docs support supplied classloader find implementation classes needed instantiate classes resource appears classloader supplying jaxb unable find edit adding relevant portion generated class pginterval resource guess worth noting import generated class javas standard library
