judging link attached assume specifically talking binary search trees rules make nodes general rule binary trees extension subtrees ul li child node greater node li li child left node smaller node li ul child tree highest left child tree lowest mind binary trees slightly binary search trees rules necessarily apply binary trees lets binary search tree suppose highest node tree start node root traversing child node children start node move node end node highest tree similarly searching lowest node tree start root node tree traversing left child left children exist source learned data structures algorithms university student hope helps feel free correct mistakes made
