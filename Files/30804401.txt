found solution figured exact root problem op code enlighten mark answer initially thought causing infinite loop originally set shown theory turned correct removing caused infinite loop emitted throwing back gui thread making binding emitted table values stayed initial binding find worked created conversion method called replaced calls work great setups solution explain working mark accepted answer strong em update em strong issues observables emitting fx threads values populating found resolved hold emit calling thread subscribes fx thread synchronization read wrappers returned strong em final update em strong tomas mikula gave helpful insight behavior solution reactfx github project href https github tomasmikula reactfx issues rel nofollow https github tomasmikula reactfx issues
