matrix chain multiplication algorithm wikipedia incorrect 
implementation wikipedia page href http en wikipedia org wiki matrix chain multiplication rel nofollow matrix chain multiplication incorrect change qualified mathmematician comfortable making change vetting observation guess correct assertion strong strong version written based indexes unlike pseudocode version introduced page h2 edit h2 answering question heres explains problem created shifting algorithm based index array cost tables generated adding index shift wrong places matrix chaining parenthesize matrices starters correct output means split abcd bcd br means split bcd bc optimal cost calculation 

implementation correct changing break program test copying code file called matrixorderoptimization adding function compiling running program proposed change youll making proposed change results invalid index values solution defined index achieved optimal cost called pseudocode implementation treats point pseudocode indices start implementation start meaning cases strong index achieved optimal cost strong modify indices adding youre throwing rest program changing change array accesses line code refers change words replace effect proposed change adding optimal index pull array propose adding optimal index stick array cases incorrect program crashes meaning em optimal index em simply em optimal index em program expects optimal indices understands optimal indices meaning start alter values adding violate meaning indices break program
