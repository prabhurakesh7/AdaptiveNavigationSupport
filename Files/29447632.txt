writing array bytes file large file size 
grayscale images representation form dimensional array strong bytes strong values depending respective bitrate strong strong apply compression algorithms strong run length encoding strong extract array byte smaller size represents compression operation reconstruct bitmap file original form successfully represents decompression operation image back result decompression operation problem compression operation store resulting array file content extracted back time decompression writing strong text strong file writing strong binary strong file cases size file bigger original bitmap file size blockquote 512x512 bitmap file size 32kb compressed text file size 272kb compressed binary file size 257kb bitmaps byte array size compressed array size blockquote compressed array smaller original array extracted bitmap file save file smaller size bitmap explained properly details needed 

math br kb br means original array holds bit makes sense grayscale takes space byte br apply blockquote compression algorithms blockquote true resulting array apply compression increase size image factor reason youre reading bitmap file raw bytes
