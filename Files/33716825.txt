lmax disruptor determines batch size 
recently learning lmax disruptor experimentation thing puzzling parameter handler method code dummy message consumer classes call notice put delay milliseconds substitute real world work printing console sequence number driver class acting producer called initializing required stuffs feeding messages buffer size monitor couple things delay producer claiming slot messages sequence numbers consumer side sequence considered end batch interestingly ms delay involved processing message output remove ms wait time message considered end batch size batch influenced consumers message processing delay stupid whats reasoning determines batch size general advance question unclear
