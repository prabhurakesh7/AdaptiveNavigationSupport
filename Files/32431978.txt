big notation single loop covering halves array iterator vars 
brush big understanding test basic big understanding required coming practice problems book gave snippet pretty easy understand iterators covering half array fixed amount work clocks 2n forgive current understanding attempt solution problem found examples big online iterators increment modify array basically time fact loop making mind clearing 

blockquote fact loop making blockquote correct making loop loop depends size array constant factor big notation ignores constant factor means influence algorithm based size array takes half time matter big words algorithm takes time big size loop changed constant factor logarithmic exponential function instance size loop size loop size loop case instance loop independent size loop times loop size algorithm operate constant time blockquote em wondering equation ballpark correct em blockquote fact equation ends form constant result greater smaller
