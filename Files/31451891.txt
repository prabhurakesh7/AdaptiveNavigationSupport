intersection list int types streams 
generate list type int common arrays form lists values equal efficiently streams 

stream solution isn efficient performing biglist size smalllist size operations fly resorting intermediate storage strongly recommended shouldn set operations semantics source result ordering handle duplicates source lists unspecified
