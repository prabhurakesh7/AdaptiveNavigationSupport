attempting break loop 
spent couple hours searching internet book answers finally resorted post question break loop user inputs enter doesnt break loop correct problem code advance 

problem reading input stream readers time excessive number readline calls errors code user data blockquote br world br kool br time squash bugs br br br lol nope blockquote code line line nextline call read stream loop br happening br line removed input stream assigned previous empty string lost read stream loop br happening br line world removed input stream assigned previous lost read stream loop br happening br line kool removed input stream assigned previous world lost output standard output stream loop br happening br line kool printed standard output stream system fourth read stream loop br happening br fourth line time squash bugs removed input stream assigned previous kool lost equalsignorecase string called result assignment loop br happening br fourth line input time squash bugs tested strings equal ignoring capitalization block skipped code execution continues block end loop point forcefully terminated loop execution back loops condition condition loop execute starts top read stream loop br happening br line removed input stream assigned previous time squash bugs lost sixth read stream loop br happening br sixth line removed input stream assigned previous lost output standard output stream loop br happening br sixth line printed standard output stream system seventh read stream loop br happening br seventh line lol nope removed input stream assigned previous lost equalsignorecase string called result assignment loop br happening br seventh line input lol nope tested strings equal ignoring capitalization block skipped code execution continues block end loop point forcefully terminated loop execution back loops condition condition true loop execute starts top br br br input input lol nope call blocks program freezes unable input code set line including fourth line user input read checked equality blockquote br world br kool br strong time squash bugs br strong br br strong lol nope strong blockquote fix rid variables altogether vice versa rid pulling data input stream job creating unnecessary confusing code fix input variable calls readline nextline calls eliminate trash input data rid call readline nextline store stays assignment fact multiple calls readline nextline retrieve user data data include replace calls readline nextline block reads input immediately checks equals br br fixes code depending assuming trimmed code didnt relevant simply hasnt added code run inside loop
