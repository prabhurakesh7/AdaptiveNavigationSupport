multithreading threadsafe counter 
starting simple multithreading make threadsafe counter create threads increment counter intermittently reach code loop means thread access counter reaches output fix threads share counter 

threads access variable phenomenon called thread starvation entering guarded portion code missed earlier threads block thread holding monitor monitor em released em whilst expect current thread pass monitor thread waiting line synchronized blocks guarantee fairness ordering policy thread recieves monitor strong thread releases attempts reacquire monitor hold thread waiting strong oracle blockquote starvation describes situation thread unable gain regular access shared resources unable make progress shared resources made unavailable long periods greedy threads suppose object synchronized method takes long time return thread invokes method frequently threads frequent synchronized access object blocked blockquote whilst threads examples greedy threads repeatedly release reacquire monitor thread technically started starving thread solution concurrent synchronization method supports fairness reentrantlock shown removal keyword favor reentrantlock method system fairness policy long waiting threads chance execute removing starvation
