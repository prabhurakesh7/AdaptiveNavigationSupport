code marks cells visited arbitrary path reaches cell cell aswell marked visited cells wont visited means algorithm finishes subset paths traversals break middle array bigger arrays youll mark cells visited separately path simply reset map access cell efficient simple cellstate reset accessing cell remain marked previous path
