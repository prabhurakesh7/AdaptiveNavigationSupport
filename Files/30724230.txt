difference performance adding element treeset versus adding elements arraylist transferring treesset addall method treeset red black tree data structure basic internal workings process faster sc object scanner class deeply appreciated advance 

method optimization instance cases iterates collection adds elements make sense put elements method worse performance higher memory consumption big perspective solutions complexity edit treeset important properties elements unique sorted interested unique elements property hashset give complexity
