wondering optimize storing procedural information acessing specific elements list data creating vegetation world system starts makes line element back increases position create line track object storing data position rotation texture model arraylists access needed collision detection wondering store acess data acessing information arraylists kind stupid elements order find desired data 

forest independant behavior solution bad optimize cpu reduce iteration count list maps associates screen regions forests position player check collision forests screen region strong edit question strong love game programming enjoy initial message tree independant behavior good independant player touches tree tree react move choice check tree region player order reaction touched tree player touches tree tree react player reacts stopping factorize collision detection collision calculated region user region trees located multiple rectangles cover tree collision detection forced iterate lists
