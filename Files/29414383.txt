calculating bandwidth sending packets linear regression 
implemented tcp client server model test bandwidth server sending number packets sizes rtt calculate bandwidth linear regression server code method client class return array rtt packet slope returns bw kilo bytes network bandwidth wrong 

obliged linear regression estimator linear regression approach curious happen sources suggest kind situation initial bw measurements smaller real maximal goodput due tcp slow start important metric estimation takes large wrong outliers account previous work strong harmonic strong monitor bandwidth longer period time worked pretty good links large bandwidth advantage strong harmonic strong means easy compute mitigates impact large outliers meaning estimate easily falsified series bandwidth measurements strong harmonic strong calculated total total good practice skip measurement values depending measure initial bursts due initial preparations layers slow start phase implementation case measurement file download easily applied environment simply echo server file download additionally sake completeness mentioned comments important test messages files big tcp reaches full goodput potential link simplified estimate bandwidth start measuring taking timestamp request meaning include link propagation server processing delay return reduce estimated local network expect sum delays small means falsify final estimate wrote small blog post href http fishi devtail weblog measuring bandwidth round trip time tcp connection inside application layer rel nofollow measuring tcp connection metrics inside application layer detail code examples
