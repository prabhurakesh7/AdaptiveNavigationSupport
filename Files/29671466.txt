externally provided callbacks run prefer risk catching recovering errors recoverable phases callback executions allowed throw error error repeats row case marked invalid longer run user manually launches method meant handle understand primitive approach start problem code method allways returns false output generated method happen 

doesnt override behaves compare classes
