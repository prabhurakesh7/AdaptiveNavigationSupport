libgdx references counted assetmanager case 
created assetmanger class called assetstest created class called mydemo created texture references texture1 amp texture2 reference assetstest manager refcount references texture1 amp texture2 call assetstest load refcount calling assetstest load create objects stored memory address concept correct 

directly libgdx documentation strong means load asset multiple times shared memory strong load texture1 texture2 point texture shared takes memory ref count strong update strong texture1 texture2 point object bgscreen shared sense reference variables pointing memory address item loaded asset manager reused shared case means object created time reference bgscreen png ref count 2nd part question clarify things assetmanager load strong doesnt load strong assets method strong enqueues assets strong call manager update manager isfinished strong strong assets youve enqueued load method loaded memory call load texture call manager update end references object bgscreen png unnecessary shared reference object efficiency answers question dont forget accept response
