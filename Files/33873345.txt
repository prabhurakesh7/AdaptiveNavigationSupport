unwrap streamex plain stream 
streamex powerfull library point dont superpowers anymore rid streamex internal overhead pose problem 

public api method unwrap stream purpose general class compatible original api pass code accepting simple fear overhead low additional call stream step eliminated jit compiler overhead eliminated jit appears stream creation evaluation depend number elements stream terminal operation occurs processing handed original stream evaluation streamex library code running overhead significant create simple short streams create instance inside case performance matters dont specific operations nested good idea avoid inside tests difference significant artificial cases operations optimized compared stream api equivalents faster simple create map collect operation work times faster compared
