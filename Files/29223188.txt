selection sort insertion sort 
output integer randomly generated array copied times sort algorithm insertion sort selection sort friend swaps comparisons counting swaps comparisons differently algorithms worse case scenario algorithms 

back created testing program visualize sorting custom array type registered swap count comparison count access running tests generally bubble sort comparisons due fact elements compared average times repeated times element compare elements element compare hundred runs hr insertion sort reaches element temporary compare average times finds lower element perform average comparisons working array gradually bigger thousand runs element compare element compare values values youre calculations spot provable examining algorithms
