answer aims improve design solution turn answer actual question op happy current design question answered removing line blockquote make machine firstqueue blockquote method directly object inside queue removing stated comments machine removed queue access instance machine suffice adding queue interpreting design wrong state state depends execute execute true isnt wise handling state machine adding removing executing queues abstraction sort lets called creates manages handles state implementing listening interface machine report events problems determine handle events ill explain interface implement communications requires instance passed machine strong strong queues state called state machine implements method method called added queue processing assume classes processing pass queues makes nice logic handling state feel free questions
