object matching opencv 
found chamfer matching opencv function python unable find feature strong opencv strong find interface recognize fruits apples match precomputed apple contour found contours image chamfer matching finding apple planning classifier make color texture correct template matching bad choice doesnt work recognizing rotated objects wondering feature descriptors recognize apple dont feature descriptors good thoughts strong edit strong decided findcontours function contours image filter area compare filtered contours designated templates training matchshapes implemented working findcontours detecting apple contours ill post question specific problem sounds detect compare contours 

figured chamfer matching opencv implemented javacv sign native code opencv good solution href http stackoverflow answer helped lot easily written initially training program database images green apples training storing largest contour photo file key problem dividing image channels resulting grayscale images transform canny dilate check contours detect contours apple contours images filter size comparing single contour training data contour close assume contour apple lot false positives filtered coleague implements module checks color texture selected contours content heres href https github nsavov fruitrecognition git rel nofollow projects repository
