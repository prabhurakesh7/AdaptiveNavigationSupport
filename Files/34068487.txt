problem undoubtedly noticed ship rules possibilities subsequent ships easiest difficulty trial error write function randomly placing ship size board place ships nested loop outer loop loop iterates ships loop loop loop repeatedly calls ship placing function candidate placement checks clashes previous choices looping clash free placement found placing single ship generate random number determine ship horizontally vertically pick random number determine row column finally pick random number square row column ship size ship enter length choices square assuming standard 10x10 board edit manus raised good point difficulties encountered number ships threshold massive fleet ships small board partial placements ships rule valid placement remaining ships difficulty back tracking approach checks room ship place revisit placement previous ships works work involved checking valid position simultaneously determine set valid positions case directly pick set trial error approach essentially quick dirty approach simulating childs game sophisticated approach flexible game
