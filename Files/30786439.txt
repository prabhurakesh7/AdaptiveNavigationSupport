efficiently select neighbour dimensional dimensional space simulated annealing 
simulated annealing find local minimum single variable polynomial function predefined interval find global minimum quadratic function derivative free algorithm tackle problem study purposes algorithm pretty straight forward efficiently select neighbor single dimensional space lets local minimum function interval assume interval reduced tenths number achieve balance random walk speed convergence starting point points lower energy simply select random number form interval time random walk algorithm circle contrary point selected simply adding subtracting equal probability algorithm turn exhaustive search based starting point strong efficiently balance simulated annealing neighbor search single dimensional dimensional space strong
